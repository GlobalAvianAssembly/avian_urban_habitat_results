  - name: niche_resilience__output__niche_resiliance_result.csv
    description: Model averaging coefficents from MuMIn dredge to find predictors for proportion of niches given proportion of regional richness at hotspots. This analysis was completed three times with different clustering configurations creating three different numbers of total niches. Covers four constructed regional pools, one with birdlife regional data, one with eBird regional data, one for species in both pools, and one for species in either pool.

      - name: explanatory
        description: The name of the predictor
      - name: model
        description: Either 'full' or 'subset' from dredge selected models.
